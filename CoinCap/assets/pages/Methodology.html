            <p class="p_left_three_1">
              To calculate price, CoinCap reviews the data from markets where
              that asset is either the base or quote in a trade. Any time a
              digital asset is bought or sold, it contributes to the CoinCap
              price evaluation.
            </p>
            <p class="p_left_three_1">
              Our system evaluates every unit equally. The amount of volume
              handled by an exchange weighs on the exchange's level of
              contribution to the market-wide price.
            </p>
            <p class="p_left_three_1">
              For example, if an exchange transacts 2,000 units of a coin in a
              day and another exchange transacts 1,000 units of that coin, the
              first exchange will have twice the influence on the global price
              as the other exchange.

            The pricing conversation often leads to discussions on volume and
            whether or not some exchange’s claimed volume can be verified. The
            CoinCap team is aware and monitoring these conversations, but to
            date, no action has been taken to adjust influence of exchanges.
            Outlier detection prevents any single exchange from moving the

              CoinCap Outlier Detection There are times when CoinCap will
              receive data that can immediately be identified as flawed or
              outside the range of acceptance. To protect the integrity of our
              data, we identify flawed data and do not allow it to contribute to
              CoinCap’s calculations. The following are the security measures
              put in place to protect the integrity of our data:

            <p class="sec_four_p">
              As CoinCap receives trade price data from exchanges, our system
              compares the exchange's price to the real-time global price of
              that asset. If the price is more than 10 percent outside (above or
              below) the current global price, the data is flagged as an
              outlier. This does not prevent the price of an asset from rapidly
              gaining or losing value. Prices will climb and fall incrementally
              on markets as fulfilled orders move prices. CoinCap accepts
              incremental price movements. The 10 percent outlier detection
              prohibits a single exchange from falsely reporting a price far
              above or below the real-time market. These outlier prices will
              appear on the website with notation, but will not be used in the
              global price calculation on the digital asset.

              To have real-time information available, our system is constantly
              requesting the most up-to-date trade data from exchanges.
              Exchanges respond with data that is timestamped to show recency.
              At times, an exchange will send trade data that does not have a
              recent timestamp. Our system looks at the timestamp of every
              response to check if it is recent. Any trade data received with a
              timestamp more than four hours old will be identified as aged
              data. This aged data will appear on the website with notation, but
              will not be used in the global price calculation of the asset.

            <p>
              To identify the top digital assets, CoinCap has determined a
              ranking system based on three factors: Daily Trading Volume,
              Availability, and Market Cap.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Daily Trading Volume represents a measure called liquidity, or
                the extent to which the asset can be bought or sold without much
                risk of moving the price. Assets with high liquidity are easier
                to buy and sell in the marketplace, therefore we believe daily
                trading volume must contribute to rank.
              </li>
              <li>
                Asset Availability relates to how many exchanges trade this
                asset. When multiple exchanges offer a digital asset, it serves
                as a reference point for price, which helps ensure that the data
                you are seeing is valid. This prevents a single exchange from
                reporting a price that is not an accurate representation of the
                market.
              </li>

                Market Cap is the price multiplied by supply of an asset. This
                metric helps in understanding the total value if all available
                assets are purchased.

            statistic differs from standard market capitalization where all
            assets are considered, even if these assets are distributed in a way
            that a portion are inaccessible to buyers (held by founders, created
            but locked away until a particular date, etc).

            Free-Float Methodology is a term that has been used to apply to
            traditional markets. CoinCap believes this way of calculating market
            cap does not meet the needs of every cryptocurrency available today.
            Assets vary in how they are purchased, held, and used. Interesting
            edge-cases appear where assets may be staked in a contract to
            fulfill their purpose or “burnt” upon using. With the large number
            of assets, regular entrance of new assets to the market, and variety
            of uses of these assets, perhaps market capitalization is a flawed
            metric used to compare cryptocurrencies.

            <br />
            At CoinCap, we often question whether or not traditional metrics
            meet current needs for the industry. For this reason, market cap is
            only one of three factors that contributes to CoinCap’s Rank.
            Alternatives to market capitalization (free-float or otherwise) are
            being explored by the CoinCap team.
