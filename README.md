## About

This repository showcases a collection of web development exercises and UI replicas, created as a way to practice core front-end development skills. The projects demonstrate:

- **HTML** for structuring content
- **CSS** for layout, design, and styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic features
- **APIs** for fetching external data

The repository is intended for developers who want to practice building real-world layouts and working with APIs, focusing on responsive design and clean code practices.
